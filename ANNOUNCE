Ocarina v1.1
============

The Ocarina team is proud to announce the release of Ocarina 1.1
 (available at http://aadl.enst.fr)

Ocarina is a set of libraries to manipulate AADL models. Ocarina is
compliant with AADL 1.0, and some extensions from AADL 2.0.

Ocarina is available as both source and binary packages for Windows,
Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X.

To download Ocarina, go to http://aadl.enst.fr/ocarina

To download Ocarina + PolyORB-HI AADL runtime, go to
http://aadl.enst.fr/polyorb-hi/

Ocarina proposes

* AADL parser and pretty printer

* Code generation features for generating distributed applications on top of 
  the PolyORB schizophrenic middleware

* Code generation features for generating High-Integrity distributed
  applications on top of the PolyORB-HI AADL middleware

Ocarina comes with a set of examples to demonstrate these different features.
For discussing Ocarina features, you can use the ocarina-users mailing list.

Ocarina is primarily developed by Bechir Zalila, Jerome Hugues and
Laurent Pautet at ENST (http://www.enst.fr).

Ocarina v1.0-alpha
==================

Ocarina is a tool suite to manipulate, verify and process AADL
descriptions. It provides a set of specialized modules built around a
central core that manages the AADL model. Modules provide functions
such as parse/print AADL description in different syntax, perform
model analysis, generate code from a model, etc.

Ocarina is primarily developed by Thomas Vergnaud and Laurent Pautet
(Télécom Paris).


* Contents

This pre-release provides two main modules:

** Ocarina core:

The core of Ocarina provides basic functions to manipulate an abstract
syntax tree representing an AADL mode:

- an API to insert elements into the tree

- functionnalities to scan the whole tree; callback functions can be
associated to the tree nodes, in order to process the description

- basic checks on the structure: completeness, type consistency, etc.
 
** AADL parser and printer:

These modules can read or write a description in the AADL syntax. They
rely on the Ocarina core.


* Important Note

This pre-release must be considered as an unstable version. This means
it may crash or produce incomplete results. Yet, it works for common
AADL descriptions and can be used as a description validator.


* AADL

AADL (Architecture Analysis & Design Language) is an architecture
description language targetted to the description of embedded
real-time systems (e.g. avionics). More information can be found on
the AADL web site: http://www.aadl.info
